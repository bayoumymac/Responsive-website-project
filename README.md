# Responsive-website-project
A fully custom responsive website 

## Getting Started
To better understand front end development and technologies, I set out to build a responsive mobile first webiste while minimizing the use of both javascript libraries and css frameworks, luckily a friend needed a website and it was a perfect candidate for this project

Workflow tools included: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Grunt

## Process
1. content planning and wireframing
2. desinging some mockups for the landing page in sketch
3. used feedback on landing pages' mockups to finalize the look and feel of the website
4. finished the full website mockup including different screen sizes
5. Created and implemented a custom CSS grid system, with CSS media queries for mobile responsiveness
6. Tested front-end code in multiple browsers to ensure cross-browser compatability
7. Used grunt to automate the production tools such as npm packages for minifying and responsive images workflow
