# Responsive-website-project
A fully custom responsive website 

## Getting Started
To better understand front end development and technologies, I set out to build a responsive mobile first webiste while minimizing the use of both javascript libraries and css frameworks, luckily a friend needed a website and it was a perfect candidate for this project

## Process
1. content planning and wireframing
2. desinging some mockups for the landing page in sketch
3. used feedback on landing pages' mockups to finalize the look and feel of the website
4. finished the full website mockup including different screen sizes
